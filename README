This program is basically based on Supervised Learning algorithm approach
Note: You need to train your own hand dataset to the model by running "dataset_finger.py" to capture the hand signs more accurately
this code basically maps on your fingers and thumb coordinates so make sure to capture your hand correctly
do mention the file path where you stored the "dataset_(alphabet letter).csv" file to avoid filenotfound error
Expecting a star for this ;)))
